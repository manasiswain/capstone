Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until flour mixture is moistened. Do not add more water than you need: when you squeeze a handful of the moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball. Divide the dough in half and shape into balls. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 2. Transfer one dough ball to a lightly floured surface. Roll dough from the center to the edges to form a 12-inch circle. Wrap crust around the rolling pin. Unroll it onto a 9-inch pie plate. Ease crust into the pie plate, being careful not to stretch it. Trim the bottom crust evenly with the rim of the pie plate, and return the pastry-lined pie plate to the refrigerator. 3. Make the filling: Mix sugar and cornstarch together in a large bowl.
